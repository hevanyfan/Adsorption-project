# Mission O2 — Breakthrough Model (Part 2)

This repo contains a ready-to-run Python implementation for the **dynamic breakthrough simulation** used in **CHEN40461/60461 — Advanced Separation Processes (AY 2025–26)**.

## What’s included
- `asp_breakthrough_model.py` — Fits Sips isotherms (Table 1) and simulates 1D breakthrough (axial dispersion + LDF).
- `requirements.txt` — Minimal dependencies.
- `outputs/` — Created at runtime for CSV and figures.

## How to run (Jupyter)
```python
%run asp_breakthrough_model.py
